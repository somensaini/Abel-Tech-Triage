# Tickets App Frontend
This is a demo build of a full-stack web application built for a client who requested a ticketing system for their employees. It is a user-friendly application designed to streamline the workflow of employees. This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing and tracking requests, and ensuring efficient communication between employees.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Redux, and JWT.

This web application is built on the MERN stack along with Redux for state management and JWT for authentication.

Employees are able to log in and add new tickets or view existing tickets. Administrators and Managers are able to modify Employee accounts/permissions and create/view/delete tickets. The data for the accounts and tickets are stored in a database using MongoDB.

## Lessons Learned:

Building an application with the MERN stack reinforced the importance of modular architecture. Using Redux for state management proved to be essential, especially in a complex application like this. Integrating JWT for authentication was a security component that I could not compromise on as different levels of employees would need access to certain aspects of the application.
